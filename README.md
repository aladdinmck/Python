# Python
I created this repository in order to practice using ML python libraries.

# Numpy
I created Matricies & Vectors and performed matrix operations using Numpy.

# Scipy 
Scipy was used to manipulate an image's resolution and tint. 
I found this much easier than using gimp or photoshop. 

# Scikit-Learn
Used Scikit-learn to create a simple decision tree classifier.
